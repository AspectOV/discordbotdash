            A.S.P.E.C.T grows with you: start with core moderation and welcoming tools, then turn on engagement,
            economy, or AI helpers when your community is ready.

          <h3>What it feels like</h3>
          <p>
            Everything is designed to feel intentional: clear commands, gentle defaults, and only the modules you
            want to be visible.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:14px">
            New members see clean prompts, moderators see actionable settings, and the dashboard stays focused.

      <h2>Built around how real servers run</h2>
      <p class="subtitle" style="max-width:80ch">
        A.S.P.E.C.T balances structure and flexibility. You can guide new members, reduce admin work, and keep
        engagement steady without turning your server into a wall of commands.
      </p>
      <div class="split">
        <div>
          <p>
            Welcome flows stay clear and welcoming, moderation stays calm and transparent, and engagement tools sit
            quietly until you turn them on. You decide what appears, and members get a consistent voice across every
            feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI chat is optional and only appears when members invoke it. Economy and engagement tools are designed
            to add momentum, not clutter. Everything is modular, so you can evolve the experience over time.

      <h2>Welcome, engagement, and automation in a single flow</h2>
      <p class="subtitle" style="max-width:80ch">
        A.S.P.E.C.T keeps the member journey clear. The onboarding path, the day-to-day experience, and the behind-
        the-scenes automations live together so staff can explain how things work in one breath.
      </p>
      <div class="split">
        <div>
          <p>
            Onboarding guides new members through channels and expectations without dumping a giant rules wall.
            Engagement tools reward activity without spamming chat. Moderation tools provide visibility without
            feeling invasive.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to keep it simple, stick with the defaults. If you want to go deeper, the dashboard lets
            you refine every module when you have time.

          <h3>Designed for clarity</h3>
          <p>
            A.S.P.E.C.T is opinionated about clean UX. It prioritizes readable prompts, consistent language, and
            a steady rhythm across modules.

      <h2>A calmer journey for members</h2>

        A.S.P.E.C.T helps your community feel oriented from day one. Every step is written to feel human, not
        robotic, so members understand where to go and what to do.

            New members see a guided welcome flow, which introduces key channels and optional self-serve roles.
            When they want help, they can invoke AI chat or a utility command without the bot constantly watching
            every message.
          </p>
          <p>
            As your community grows, engagement tools highlight top contributors, while automation quietly keeps
            the server tidy. Nothing jumps out unless you enable it.

        The dashboard is intentionally calm. You get a clean overview, then dive deeper only when you need to.

      <div class="split">

            When you open the dashboard, you’ll see the essentials: module status, recent actions, and where to go
            next. Everything else is tucked into dedicated views, so you never feel like you’re scanning a wall of
            stats.
          </p>
          <p>
            The account page holds personal preferences, while each server keeps its own space for settings. It’s
